## üö® Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Password Reset Token Storage (CRITICAL)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score**: 8.5  
**Medical Device Impact**: HIGH  

**Issue Description**:
Password reset tokens are stored in the `uiPreferences` JSON field instead of a dedicated secure table with proper expiration handling.

**Location**: `/src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
uiPreferences: {
  resetToken,
  resetTokenExpires: resetTokenExpires.toISOString()
}
```

**Attack Vector**:
- JSON field lacks proper indexing and security controls
- Tokens may persist longer than intended
- Potential for data leakage through other JSON operations

**Medical Device Risk**:
- Unauthorized access to patient data systems
- Compliance violation with FDA 21 CFR Part 11
- HIPAA security breach potential

**Remediation**:
```sql
-- Create dedicated password reset table
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  token_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

### 2. Development Token Exposure (CRITICAL)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score**: 9.0  
**Medical Device Impact**: CRITICAL  

**Issue Description**:
Password reset tokens are returned in API responses during development mode, creating risk of accidental production exposure.

**Location**: `/src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  return NextResponse.json({
    message: "Password reset email sent successfully",
    resetToken // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Token exposure
  });
}
```

**Attack Vector**:
- Environment variable manipulation
- Accidental production deployment with development settings
- Log file exposure of sensitive tokens

**Medical Device Risk**:
- Complete system compromise
- Patient data breach
- FDA regulatory violations

**Remediation**:
- Remove token from all API responses
- Implement secure token delivery via encrypted email only
- Add production deployment validation checks

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection (CRITICAL)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score**: 7.8  
**Medical Device Impact**: HIGH  

**Issue Description**:
No Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection implemented for state-changing operations.

**Attack Vector**:
- Malicious websites can trigger authenticated actions
- Password reset abuse
- Unauthorized role assignments

**Medical Device Risk**:
- Unauthorized medical device configuration changes
- Patient safety compromise
- Regulatory compliance violations

**Remediation**:
```typescript
// Implement CSRF tokens
import { generateCsrfToken, validateCsrfToken } from '@/lib/security/csrf';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const csrfToken = request.headers.get('x-csrf-token');
  if (!validateCsrfToken(csrfToken)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid CSRF token' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  // ... rest of handler
}
```

---

## üî¥ High Risk Security Issues

### 4. Insufficient Rate Limiting (HIGH)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH  
**CVSS Score**: 6.8  

**Issue Description**:
Generic rate limiting implemented but lacks endpoint-specific controls for sensitive operations.

**Missing Controls**:
- Password reset: No specific rate limiting
- Login attempts: Basic lockout insufficient
- Registration: No abuse prevention

**Remediation**:
```typescript
// Implement strict endpoint-specific rate limiting
const rateLimits = {
  '/api/auth/reset-password': { maxRequests: 3, windowMs: 3600000 }, // 3/hour
  '/api/auth/register': { maxRequests: 5, windowMs: 86400000 }, // 5/day
  '/api/auth/signin': { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 900000 } // 10/15min
};
```

### 5. Session Fixation Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH  
**CVSS Score**: 6.5  

**Issue Description**:
No explicit session regeneration after successful authentication.

**Attack Vector**:
- Attacker pre-sets session ID
- User authenticates with attacker's session
- Attacker gains authenticated access

**Remediation**:
- Implement session ID regeneration after login
- Clear previous session data
- Generate new CSRF tokens

### 6. Inadequate Audit Logging (HIGH)
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH  
**Medical Device Compliance**: CRITICAL  

**Issue Description**:
Audit logging implementation lacks comprehensive coverage required for medical device compliance.

**Missing Elements**:
- User access attempts (failed and successful)
- Permission changes with approval workflow
- Data access and modification trails
- System configuration changes

**FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Requirements**:
- Electronic signatures
- Audit trail integrity
- Time stamping with user identification

## üü° Medium Risk Issues

### 7. Weak Password History Enforcement
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: No prevention of password reuse  
**Medical Device Risk**: Compliance gap with NIST guidelines

### 8. Missing Multi-Factor Authentication
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: MFA schema exists but implementation incomplete  
**Medical Device Risk**: Insufficient authentication for privileged accounts

### 9. Insufficient Input Validation
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: Medical device specific validation incomplete  
**Examples**: Device serial numbers, UDI validation, lot numbers

### 10. Timing Attack Vulnerability
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: Password verification may be vulnerable to timing attacks  
**Testing**: Timing difference analysis needed

### 11. Missing Security Headers
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: Incomplete security header implementation  
**Required**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.

### 12. Database Connection Security
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Issue**: Connection string security not verified  
**Requirements**: SSL/TLS encryption, certificate validation
