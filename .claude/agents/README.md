## üí° Use Cases

### Complete Project Automation
```
User: "Create a library management system for our company"
Result: Fully functional web application with database, API, frontend, tests, documentation, and deployment
```

### Specialized Development Tasks
```
User: "Review this authentication code for security issues"
Agent: security-analyzer performs comprehensive security audit
```

### Long-term Project Management
```
User: "Manage the development of a multi-tenant SaaS platform"
Agent: project-orchestrator coordinates all phases with appropriate specialists
```

## üìã Installation

1. **Clone or copy agent definitions** to your project's `.claude/agents/` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   # Copy the agent definition files to this directory
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/agents/
   # Should show all agent files (.md format)
   ```

3. **Start using agents** in Claude Code:
   ```
   Use the project-orchestrator agent to build a complete web application
   ```

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Starting a New Web Application
```
"I want to build a task management web application with user authentication, real-time updates, and mobile responsiveness. Handle everything from requirements to deployment."
```

The **project-orchestrator** will:
1. Use **requirements-analyst** to gather detailed requirements
2. Coordinate **system-architect** and **data-architect** for design
3. Manage implementation with development agents
4. Handle testing, deployment, and documentation
5. Provide training materials for end users

### Code Quality Review
```
"Review my e-commerce checkout process for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality."
```

Multiple agents coordinate:
- **security-analyzer** checks for vulnerabilities
- **performance-optimizer** identifies bottlenecks  
- **code-reviewer** ensures best practices

### Long-term Project Management
