# Contributing to TORVAN Medical Workflow Management System

Welcome to the TORVAN project! This document outlines our development workflow and contribution guidelines for medical software development.

## üè• Medical Software Compliance

TORVAN is a medical device workflow management system subject to regulatory requirements including:
- FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation)
- ISO 13485 (Medical devices - Quality management systems)
- IEC 62304 (Medical device software - Software life cycle processes)
- HIPAA compliance for Protected Health Information (PHI)

All contributions must maintain these compliance standards.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git 2.30+
- Understanding of medical software development principles
- Familiarity with TypeScript, Next.js, and tRPC

## üåø Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

1. **main** - Production-ready code, always deployable
2. **develop** - Integration branch for features (when using GitFlow)
3. **feature/** - New features and enhancements
4. **fix/** - Bug fixes
5. **hotfix/** - Critical production fixes
6. **release/** - Release preparation
7. **medical/** - Medical device specific features
8. **regulatory/** - Regulatory compliance updates

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Examples:
feature/123-barcode-scanning
fix/456-authentication-timeout
medical/789-patient-monitoring-dashboard
regulatory/101-fda-compliance-update
hotfix/critical-security-patch
```

### Branch Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/123-new-feature
   ```

2. **Work on Feature**
   - Make atomic commits with descriptive messages
   - Follow commit message conventions
   - Run tests frequently

3. **Stay Updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/123-new-feature
   # Create pull request via GitHub
   ```

## üìù Commit Message Standards

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `security`: Security-related changes
- `medical`: Medical device functionality
- `regulatory`: Regulatory compliance
- `compliance`: General compliance
- `audit`: Audit trail changes

### Examples
```
feat(inventory): add barcode scanning for medical devices

Implements QR and Data Matrix barcode scanning to improve
inventory tracking accuracy and reduce manual entry errors.

Closes #123
Risk-Level: Low
FDA-Reference: 21CFR820.70
```

```
fix(auth): resolve authentication timeout for surgical staff

Authentication sessions were timing out during long surgical
procedures, causing workflow interruptions.

Fixes #456
Risk-Level: Medium
Tested-By: QA Team
```

### Medical Software Guidelines
- Include regulatory context when applicable
- Specify risk level for medical device changes
- Reference quality management system documents
- Consider patient safety impact
- Maintain audit trail completeness

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd torvan-workflow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure database and other services

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Code Quality Standards

#### Pre-commit Checks
Our Git hooks automatically run:
- Prettier code formatting
- ESLint linting
- TypeScript type checking
- Sensitive data detection
- PHI/PII pattern scanning

#### Manual Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:coverage

# Build check
npm run build
```

### 3. Testing Requirements

#### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization
- **Compliance Tests**: Medical software requirements

#### Testing Standards
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage reporting (minimum 80% for medical software)
npm run test:coverage
```

### 4. Code Review Process
